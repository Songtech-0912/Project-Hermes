# Project Starwarp

The Alcubierre Metric is a mysterious yet fascinating quirk of Einstein's theory of relativity. This repository hosts my research into its workings and my attempts in understanding how it works.

Everything is organized into Jupyter notebooks, running `sympy`, `numpy`, `einsteinpy` and of course the Python programming language itself. Go install them if you haven't already. Then dive into the notebooks and code!
